# MovieSeatBooking
This was a quick and fun project from Brad Traversy's 20 Projects with Vanilla Javascript course. This project is a demonstration of a booking system built with HTML, CSS, JS that can store state on local storage and display that data in a visually appealing way.

# Features
* movie, selected seats, and total price stored on local storage
* visual representation of selected seats, and unavailable seats
